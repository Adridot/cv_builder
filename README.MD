# Computer programming project - CV Builder
### Adrien Didot - Emmanuel Cousin


## Introduction
The aim of the project is to help students to build their CV, by simply filling up some fields. 
We will do this by doing a web application, where the user will be able to fill up the fields of the CV. 

The back-end will be a Python API, which will be used to generate the PDF file. 
We will develop it, using the Django framework.

To generate the PDF file, we will use the [PyLaTeX](https://github.com/JelteF/PyLaTeX) library.
